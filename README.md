# worklife-tech-test

Technical test for Worklife's hiring process

## Project Setup

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

### run locally

```sh
yarn dev
```

You can now access webapp at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

## Improvements

- Alert the user when an artwork failed to load (e.g. with a toast)
- Add a "Go back to top" button
- Enhance the form validation
- Rework Select component for more UI customisation
- Add a prepend icon on the text input
- Each tile requires 2 requests. It's not satisfying. It would also be relevant to search if lower quality images are available.
- Enhance the accessibility, allowing to focus the tiles
